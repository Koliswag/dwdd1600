        <h1>Drop Style Shopping</h1>
        <P> We use a Drop Style shopping method to provide our products to our costomers. This may be new to some, so we have a few FAQ's listed below.</P>

        <dt>What is Drop Style Shopping?</dt>
            <dd>We as designers and creators spend countless hours working on many pieces that we eventually release on the website to be purchased by you, the customers. These releases are called "Drops". We "drop" only a certain amount of each product in every release to keep ownership limited making each purchase more personal. We focus on one line at a time while designing usually keeping up with which athletic season we are in. </dd>
            <dt> When are the drops?</dt>
            <dd> The drop dates for each specific clothing line are listed below.</dd>
            <dt> How do I know what is going to be dropped?</dt>
            <dd> A few weeks befor each drop, a catalog will be accessable to see what items will be purchasable in the next drop. Follow our instagram to stay up to date. @Koliclothing.</dd>
